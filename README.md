# Functional-techniques-in-Java
Adding functional programming capabilities
to an object-oriented language leads to
benefits in object-oriented programming
design.
Practices in OOP languages include emulations of
FP techniques:
C++ programmers: function pointers and
overloadings of the () operator, i.e.
“object-functions” or functors.
Java programmers: anonymous classes and
introspection/reflexion
